= Major religious holidays to avoid for your events:

Here are the major religious holidays you need to be aware of when planning events. The list covers holy days where 

* Work is prohibited (or most people observing consider it a day to be with family)

AND

* Followed by most of it's adherents

"Most" is a tricky term and is definitely geography dependent. If you live in a Christian majority country - the holy days below 
are like Christmas or Easter. Before you schedule an event during these days think if you would schedule the same event during
Christmas or Easter. 

If you edit a category below please:

1. Try define most, especially with regards to important geographies. 
2. Please try to give the rough time of year so people can know when to look for the holy day on the calendar. 
3. Try to give the length of the holy day (start time and end time). 
4. If you know there is popular misconception of the importance certain days please note those days as well.

== Hinduism

Hinduism has a number of important festivals, and the significance of these varies by the region the person came from. Hinduism follows a lunar calendar. There are very few days when work is prohibited, but quite a few when people will choose to be with family. Some of these days are important regional holidays in India, but limited to cultural celebrations outside that region.

this time it would be best to just avoid having people miss the first night. 

If you are planning an event in Israel this list will not work. There are many observant Jews in Israel and you should
consult a local observant Jew about dates. Please note there is also a sizable number of Christians and Muslims in Israel, 
be sure to consult their calendar as well.

Some countries attach a particular importance to certain holidays, which tend to be 3 or 4 day family holidays.
